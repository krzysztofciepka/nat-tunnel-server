    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Server for nat-tunnel CLI tool</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>nat-tunnel {name} {local host} {local port}</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Connection is based on TCP sockets. <br /><br />
      Nat-tunnel client requests a dedicated TCP socket on nat-tunnel server and
      binds it to the locally running service via a duplex stream<br /><br />
      Nat-tunnel service creates a dedicated subdomain for client and streams
      all HTTP requests on that domain to the socket<br /><br />
      When the local service responds, a HTTP response is sent back to the
      original requester<br /><br />
      Connection stays active as long as nat-tunnel client is running
